## Welcome to the roomate organization website
This is a website I am making quickly to practice web development fundamentals. The goal of this website is to help my upcoming roommates and I organize what items we will need to bring to our new apartment! The principal areas I want to practice with this are database and backend development. I will be using AI tools in the creation of this website, but far less so in the two topics I have identified above (and more in an educational manner).
